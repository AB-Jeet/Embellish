# :scroll: Instructions to follow while contributing -
#
-   Make sure that with every design/ component should be added to a separate folder.
-   Every folder should have its own `README.md` file where instructions to setup environment should be there and a demo video in the form of a gif should be added. Refer to the [README Template](README_TEMPLATE.md) to make the README for the component you add.
-   Always update the table of contents in the parent folder where the new component is added.
-   Whether you are adding an animation or a design component or any other code, **make sure to include all the additional scripts and CDN's within the file/ folder itself and with addequate documentation as required. The code must be extremely simple to understand such that it is ready for immediate use in some project.**
