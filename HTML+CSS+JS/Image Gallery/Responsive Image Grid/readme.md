## Responsive Image Grid
- You can use this to showcase diffrent sized images on your site with an ease.
  
 ## You ask how to?
 - Implimenting it is very easy, you just have to copy the div (I have also commented in the index.html file) along with its styling from style.css
 - You can replace the images with yours, I have also mentioned small, big, medium sized images.
  
### Its completely responsive!
